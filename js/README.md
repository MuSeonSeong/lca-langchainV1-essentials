# ðŸ”— LangChain Essentials - TypeScript

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Deno installed:

```bash
# Install Deno
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
# Install Deno Jupyter Kernel
deno jupyter --install
# Activate Deno Jupyter Kernel
deno jupyter --unstable
```

You should be able to select the Deno kernel from the available kernels list.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/lca-langchainV1-essentials.git
cd ./lca-langchainV1-essentials/js
```

2. Install the package and dependencies:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

```bash
# Create .env file
cp example.env .env
```

Add your API keys to the `.env` file:

```env
# Required for model usage
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: For evaluation and tracing
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key_here
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=lc-essentials
```

### Running Jupyter Notebooks

If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can install it using pip or pipx:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install jupyter jupyterlab

# Or using pipx (recommended for isolated installation)
pipx install jupyterlab
```

Once Jupyter is installed and the Deno kernel is set up (see Prerequisites), start Jupyter:

```bash
# Start Jupyter Lab (recommended)
python3 -m jupyterlab
```

This will open Jupyter in your browser. When opening any of the `.ipynb` files in this directory, make sure to select the **Deno** kernel from the kernel selector in the top-right corner of the notebook interface.


5. Setup LangSmith Studio

```bash
#copy the .env file you created above to the studio directory
cp .env ./studio/.

#to run
langgraph dev
```
For more information on the LangSmith Studio, see the [documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/studio)

# Lessons
This repository contains nine short notebooks that serve as brief introductions to many of the most-used features in LangChain, starting with the new **Create Agent**.

---

### `L1_fast_agent.ipynb` - ðŸ¤– Create Agent ðŸ¤–
- In this notebook, you will use LangChainâ€™s `create_agent` to build an SQL agent in just a few lines of code.  
- It demonstrates how quick and easy it is to build a powerful agent. You can easily take this agent and apply it to your own project. 
- You will also use **LangSmith Studio**, a handy visual debugger to run, host, and explore agents.

---

### `L2-7.ipynb` - ðŸ§± Building Blocks ðŸ§±
In Lessons 2â€“7, you will learn how to use some of the fundamental building blocks in LangChain. These lessons explain and complement `create_agent`, and youâ€™ll find them useful when creating your own agents. Each lesson is concise and focused.

- **L2_messages.ipynb**: Learn how messages convey information between agent components.  
- **L3_streaming.ipynb**: Learn how to reduce user-perceived latency using streaming.  
- **L4_tools.ipynb**: Learn basic tool use to enhance your model with custom or prebuilt tools.  
- **L5_tools_with_mcp.ipynb**: Learn to use the LangChain MCP adapter to access the world of MCP tools.  
- **L6_memory.ipynb**: Learn how to give your agent the ability to maintain state between invocations.  
- **L7_structuredOutput.ipynb**: Learn how to produce structured output from your agent.  

---

### `L8-9.ipynb` - ðŸª› Customize Your Agent ðŸ¤–
Lessons 2â€“7 covered out-of-the-box features. However, `create_agent` also supports both prebuilt and user-defined customization through **Middleware**. This section describes middleware and includes two lessons highlighting specific use cases.

- **L8_dynamic.ipynb**: Learn how to dynamically modify the agentâ€™s system prompt to react to changing contexts.  
- **L9_HITL.ipynb**: Learn how to use Interrupts to enable Human-in-the-Loop interactions.





## ðŸ“š Tutorial Overview

This repository contains nine short notebooks which are brief introductions many of the most-used features in LangChain starting with the new Create Agent.

### `L1_fast_agent.ipynb` - ðŸ¤– Create Agent ðŸ¤–
- In this notebook, you will build and use LangChain's `create_agent` to build an SQL agent in a few lines of code.
- This notebook demonstrates how quick and easy it is to build a very powerful agent.
- You will also use LangSmith Studio, a handy visual debugger to run, host, and explore agents.


### `L2-7.ipynb` - ðŸ§± Building blocks ðŸ§±
In Lessons 2-7, you will learn to use some of the building blocks in LangChain. These explain and complement `create_agent`, and you will find them useful when creating your own agents. There are many lessons, but each is a quick look.

 - **L2_messages.ipynb**: Learn how messages convey information between components of the agent.
 - **L3_streaming.ipynb**: Learn to reduce user-perceived latency using streaming.
 - **L4_tools.ipyb**: Learn basic tool use to enhance your model with custom or prebuilt tools.
 - **L5_tools_with_mcp.ipynb**: Learn to use the Langchain mcp adaptor to access the world of mcp tools.
 - **L6_memory.ipynb**: Learn to give your agent the ability to maintain state between invocations.
 - **L7_structuredOutput.ipynb**: Learn to use your agent to produce structured output.
 - 
### L8-9.ipynb - ðŸª› Customize Your Agent ðŸ¤–
Lessons 2-7 covered out-of-the-box features. However, `create_agent` supports pre-built and user-created customization by adding access to the agent via Middleware. This section describes middleware and has two lessons on particular instances of its use.

- **L8_dynamic.ipynb**: Learn to create and change the agents' system prompt on the fly to react to current situations.
- **L9_HITL.ipynb**: Learn to use Interrupts to gain Human in the Loop interactions.
