# ðŸ”— LangChain Essentials V1.0

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

### Prerequisites

Ensure you're have Deno installed:

```bash
# Install Deno
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
# Install Deno Jupyter Kernel
deno jupyter --install
# Activate Deno Jupyter Kernel
deno jupyter --unstable
```

You should be able to select the Deno kernel from the available kernels list.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/lca-langchainV1-essentials.git
cd ./lca-langchainV1-essentials/js
```

1. Install the package and dependencies:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

```bash
# Create .env file
cp example.env .env
```

Add your API keys to the `.env` file:

```env
# Required for model usage
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: For evaluation and tracing
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key_here
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=lc-essentials
```

### Running Jupyter Notebooks

If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can install it using pip or pipx:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install jupyter jupyterlab

# Or using pipx (recommended for isolated installation)
pipx install jupyterlab
```

Once Jupyter is installed and the Deno kernel is set up (see Prerequisites), start Jupyter:

```bash
# Start Jupyter Lab (recommended)
python3 -m jupyterlab
```

This will open Jupyter in your browser. When opening any of the `.ipynb` files in this directory, make sure to select the **Deno** kernel from the kernel selector in the top-right corner of the notebook interface.
